# AURA-G : The Course Guide 🎓💬

Welcome to the **AURA-G**! 🚀 This project allows you to interactively inquire about Ahmedabad University's courses. The system leverages AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide structured, clear, and engaging responses to your questions.

# Features 

* **Interactive Q&A:** Ask questions about course names, faculty, schedules, teaching materials, evaluation components, and more.
* **AI-Powered Responses:** Utilizes advanced language models and RAG for accurate and context-based answers.
* **Streamlit Interface:**  Easy-to-use web interface for seamless interaction.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 🧠

This project implements RAG to enhance the quality and accuracy of responses:

1. **Retrieval:** 🔍 The system indexes course information from PDF files and retrieves relevant content based on user queries.
2. **Augmentation:** 🔗 Retrieved information is used to provide context to the AI model.
3. **Generation:** ✍️ An AI model generates natural language responses, combining its knowledge with the retrieved course-specific information.

By using RAG, the Course Information Assistant can provide more accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date answers about specific courses, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Installation 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:** 📂
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushp2207/AURA-G-The-Course-Guide
    cd AURA-G-The-Course-Guide
    ```

2. **Install the Required Packages:** 📦
    Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:** 🔑
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
    ```
    You can also store the API key using Streamlit Secrets:
    ```python
    # In Streamlit Cloud, add the secret directly in the UI
    st.secrets["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your-google-api-key"
    ```

4. **Add PDF Files:** 📄
    Place your course PDFs in the `pdfs` folder. Ensure the filenames contain course code followed by name of the course (e.g., `CSD102 - Data Science.pdf`).

## Usage 

1. **Run the Application:** 🏃‍♂️
    Start the Streamlit server:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the Assistant:** 💬
    - Enter the course name to search for the corresponding PDF.
    - Ask questions about the course details, and the assistant will provide responses based on the content of the PDF.

3. **Example Questions:** 
    - "Who is the faculty for the course?"
    - "What is the course schedule?"
    - "What materials will be used for teaching?"
